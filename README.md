# Daily DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice

Welcome to the Daily DSA repository! This repository is dedicated to daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, sharpening your problem-solving skills, or just love coding challenges, this is the place for you.

## About

This repository is meant to serve as a structured space for practicing DSA problems regularly. Each day, a new problem will be added to the repository. You're encouraged to contribute your own solutions in different languages as well.

## Getting Started

To get started with your daily DSA practice, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ankit-Rautela/DSA.git
   ```

2. **Choose a problem**: Each day, a new problem will be added to the repository. Browse through the `problems` directory to find the latest problem statement.

3. **Solve the problem**: Once you've chosen a problem, work on solving it in your preferred programming language. You can find examples of solutions in various languages within the `solutions` directory.

4. **Contribute**: After solving the problem, contribute your solution by following the contribution guidelines mentioned below.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone! If you've solved a problem and want to share your solution, follow these guidelines:

1. **Create a new branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch with a descriptive name related to the problem you're solving.
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Add your solution**: Add your solution to the `solutions` directory. Make sure to include comments to explain your code and include your name or username in the file name.
   ```
   solutions/
   ├── problem_name_solution_username.py
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**: Once you've added your solution, commit your changes with a descriptive message.
   ```
   git commit -m "Added solution for problem_name"
   ```

4. **Push your branch**: Push your branch to the repository.
   ```
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

5. **Open a pull request**: Finally, open a pull request with details about the problem you solved and any additional information you'd like to share.
